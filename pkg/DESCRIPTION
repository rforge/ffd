Depends: R (>= 2.10), methods, graphics, tcltk, tkrplot, R2HTML
SystemRequirements: BWidget
Description: Functions, S4 classes/methods and a graphical user interface (GUI) to design surveys to substantiate freedom from disease using a modified hypergeometric function (see Cameron and Baldock, 1997). Herd sensitivities are computed according to sampling strategies "individual sampling" or "limited sampling" (see M. Ziller, T. Selhorst, J. Teuffert, M. Kramer and H. Schlueter, 2002). Methods to compute the a-posteriori alpha-error are implemented. Risk-based targeted sampling is supported.
