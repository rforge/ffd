            Introduction
        </h2>

        <p>
            In practice, when conducting surveys to substantiate freedom from disease in large populations two-stage sampling strategies are often used in order to account for herd-level clustering of diseases. With two-stage sampling the questions that need to be addressed are a) how many herds need to be sampled and b) how many animals per herd need to be tested. Using a modified hypergeometric formula the optimal sample sizes can elegantly be computed, while incorporating imperfect diagnostic tests and finite populations; see Cameron and Baldock (1998a,b).
        </p>

        <p>
            In the package FFD, tools for calculating optimal sample sizes (on animal and herd level) using sampling strategies "individual sampling" or "limited sampling" (see Ziller, et al., 2002) are implemented.
        </p>
            <ul>
            <li><b>Individual sampling:</b> The idea behind individual sampling is that the number of animals to test is computed for each herd size in order to guarantee a constant herd sensitivity independent of the herd size, i.e., for each herd the probability of finding a possibly present disease is the same.
            </li>
            <li><b>Limited sampling:</b> With limited sampling a pre-fixed number of animals is tested for each herd (=sample limit), irrespective of the herd size. This results in a herd sensitivity that varies with the herd size, i.e., the smaller the herd the higher the probability of finding a possibly present disease.
            </li>
            </ul>
                    
        
        <p>
            Both these sampling strategies have their merits, which can be analyzed and compared using the package FFD. Cost optimal sampling strategies can be determined finding the optimal herd sensitivity or sample limit, respectively. The package furthermore includes tools for evaluating the a-posteriori confidence corresponding to a specific sample of herds according to Kopacka et al., 2013. The package provides an easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI). More advanced users can, however, make use of the provided S4-classes and methods, as well as the underlying conventional functions in order to fully make use of the maximum flexibility offered.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Risk-based sampling
        </h2>       
        <p>
            The latest release of the package FFD now offers the possibility to use risk-based sampling. Targeting high-risk population strata, the overall sample size and the cost of the surveys can be reduced, while still maintaining the same overall significance level.

        <p>
        A simple example using simulated data of 15287 sheep holdings.
        For survey parameters design prevalence = 0.2%, significance level = 5%, intra herd
        prevalence = 20%, sensitivity of the diagnostic test = 90% and cost per tested
        animal = 7 euro, cost per tested herd = 30 euro (excluding the costs for the
        diagnostic tests) diagnostics are run in order to find the cost-optimal sample size
        for limited sampling. Click on image for full-size view.
